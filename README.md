# NewFormgenAssistant
Formgen Assistant is a tool to increase my, and eventually my teams, productivity during daily forms operations.

Current Features

Links page / Landing Page

This window contains links to websites and other programs that we use most often. This is so that everything we need to open to start our day is all in one place and can be quickly opened.

Form Name Generator

The forms team uses a searchable repository to store all the forms that we have programmed so that we can easily find and deploy forms to the dealerships who request them. To make it easier to find forms when we need to, we use a standardized naming convention for each of our forms so that we know how to search for those forms. This window allows you to plug in the information available on the form and will in turn provide the correct name for the form based on that convention. This help to reinforce our naming conventions and allows us to arrive at the correct form name without needing to remember all the “rules”.

Note Taker

When taking calls from customers it is usually necessary to take notes on the call so that we don’t have to remember things like test deal numbers, the form(s) that we are working on, or the contact information for the person we’re talking to if follow up is needed. This page segments that information and makes it easy to organize those notes and quicky copy them when needed.

Formgen Extended

To program our forms, we use an in-house tool called Formgen. Formgen has a lot of very useful features that allow us to do our job, but it’s not perfect, and sometimes there are operations we need to perform that Formgen is not capable of. This window extends the functionality of Formgen by reading the “.formgen” files used to store the forms programming done in Formgen and provides some of those features “missing” from Formgen. Here you can replace the UUID ( the unique identifier used by our repository to identify each form) so that you can make changes to a form without affecting the original (Save As). When prompting dealerships for information that is not already available in Auto/Mate there are some cases where we need to have multiple prompts that are very similar. Here you can duplicate those prompts, or remove them, in bulk when needed. There are also some cases where it can be useful to bold multiple fields on a form at once, which can also be done from this widow. This window is to be a Swiss army knife of functions that address some of the shortcomings of Formgen![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59322677/167894944-ed6122dc-75c5-47e7-b121-81acd0195d2b.png)

Future Development

There are some bugs to work out before I provide the tool to my team, and some additional features I would like to add.

I need to update the logo to match the new corporate branding.
I want to add the ability to lookup dealerships and their server/company codes from within the tool. Currently we use either our Customer Support Tool or the Client Info Report to do this.
I want to add the ability choose different themes/color schemes so that my teammates can choose a look that suits them.
There are a few look-and-feel tweaks that I would like to make to pages like Formgen Extended and the Notes page to improve their usability.
